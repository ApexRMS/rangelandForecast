This repository contains scripts that:

1) Mask state class rasters by an elevation range of 1000-2000m and by available soil data
2) Performs an adjacency analysis to estimate the probability of grassland cells transitioning to shrubland cells

These scripts build off of those available in [emchristensen/simulations_mlra42/RAP](https://github.com/emchristensen/simulations_mlra42/tree/main/RAP).

A description of the raw data used can be found [here](emchristensen/simulations_mlra42).
