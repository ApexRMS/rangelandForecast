# Rangeland Forecast

This repository contains scripts and tabular input data to generate a state-and-transition SyncroSim model for forecasting landscape change in the MLRA 42 rangeland in the southern region of New Mexico, USA. Scripts in this repository execute the following actions:

1) Performs adjacency analyses to estimate transition probabilities
2) Generates spatial and tabular model inputs for the rangleLand Forecast SyncroSim library
3) Builds the rangeland Forecast SyncroSim library from scratch

These scripts build off of those available in [emchristensen/simulations_mlra42/RAP](https://github.com/emchristensen/simulations_mlra42).
