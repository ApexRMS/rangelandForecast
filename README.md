# Rangeland Forecast

This repository contains scripts that:

1) Performs adjacency analyses to estimate transition probabilities
2) Generates spatial and tabular model inputs for the rangleLand Forecast SyncroSim library
3) Builds the rangeland Forecast SyncroSim library from scratch

These scripts build off of those available in [emchristensen/simulations_mlra42/RAP](https://github.com/emchristensen/simulations_mlra42/tree/main/RAP).

A description of the raw data used can be found [here](emchristensen/simulations_mlra42).
